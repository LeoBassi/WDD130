    <p>Hey guys!
    <p></p>Here's a little about me, I'm Brazilian and I've lived in the United Kingdom for 4 years. I love sports and outdoor activities.
    <p></p>One of the main reasons for choosing the Degree in Software Development is to develop solutions to practical problems that we face in our daily lives.
    It fascinates me to see how we can use technology to our advantage, to improve everyone's lives in every way.
    <p></p>I'm single and without children, but I intend to start building my family soon.  
    <p></p> I have been a member of the church since I was 8 years old and served my mission in Salvador - Brazil.
    <p></p>
    <p></p>Best wishes on our new adventure!</p>
